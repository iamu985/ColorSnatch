Game Puzzle

The Objective of the Game is to get all 9 cells to have same color either Red, Green or Blue.
Each square will change to a different color depending on the hierarchy which is [Red, Green, Blue].
This means that every time you click one cell, if its initial color is red it will change to green, if green then blue and if blue then red and so on.
The cells will change the color values of its adjacent cells as well.
